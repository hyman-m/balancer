tinybalancer is a reverse proxy load balancer that supports http and https. 

* It currently supports four algorithms, namely `round robin`, `random`, `the power of 2 random choice` , `consistent hash` and `ip hash`.
* tinybalancer will perform `health check` on all proxy sites periodically. When the site is unreachable, it will be removed from the balancer automatically . However, tinybalancer will still perform `health check` on unreachable sites. When the site is reachable, it will add it to the balancer automatically.
## Install
First download the source code of balancer:
```shell
> git clone https://github.com/zehuamama/tinybalancer.git
```
compile the source code:
```shell
> cd ./tinybalancer

> go build
```

## Run
Balancer needs to configure the `config.yaml` file, the content is as follows:

```yaml

# The load balancing algorithms supported by the balancer are:
# `round-robin` ,`random` ,`p2c`,`consistent-hash`, ip hash
# Among these,`p2c` refers to the power of 2 random choice.

schema: http                      # support http and https
port: 8089                        # port for balancer
ssl_certificate:
ssl_certificate_key:
tcp_health_check: true
health_check_interval: 3          # health check interval (second)
# The maximum number of requests that the balancer can handle at the same time
# 0 refers to no limit to the maximum number of requests
max_allowed: 100
location:                         # route matching for reverse proxy
  - pattern: /
    proxy_pass:                   # URL of the reverse proxy
    - "http://192.168.1.1"
    - "http://192.168.1.2:1015"
    - "https://192.168.1.2"
    - "http://my-server.com"
    balance_mode: round-robin     # load balancing algorithm
```
and now, you can execute `tinybalancer`, the balancer will print the ascii diagram and configuration details:
```shell
> ./tinybalancer
